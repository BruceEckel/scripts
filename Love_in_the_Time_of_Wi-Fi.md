# Act I: The Toast

**Setting:**  
Alex’s loft in Brooklyn. Modern, minimal, warm lighting. Dinner party vibes.  

*(The group sits around a long table. Wine is flowing, food is half-eaten. Music fades.)*

**Alex (raising glass)**  
Let’s toast to Love. But you each need to define it. One by one. No lies, no masks.

**Jules**  
Love is a neurochemical trick. Dopamine. Oxytocin. Biology manipulating us to mate.

**Mal**  
Love is theater. A fantasy we project. It’s hunger dressed as poetry.

**Ezra**  
Love is code. Data optimization. A shared operating system—until one crashes.

**Dani**  
Love is someone else’s existence making yours feel less unbearable.

**Leo**  
Love is a ghost. It promises transcendence, then vanishes. And you still want it.

**Alex**  
Maybe love is all of this. Beautiful. Brutal. Unknowable.

*(They toast.)*

**All**  
To love.

*(Lights fade.)*

# Act II: The Disruption

**Setting:**  
Later that night. Wine has loosened tongues.  

*(A knock on the door. Enter Sky Devaux, dramatic and uninvited.)*

**Sky**  
Miss me?

**Alex**  
Sky. Why are you here?

**Sky**  
To say what none of you are brave enough to.

*(Sky’s monologue)*  
Love is violence. Not fists—*intimacy*.  
It’s surrender. It’s choosing someone who could destroy you... and asking them to.

**Sky (to Alex)**  
You turned me into content.  
Love isn’t theory. It’s screaming. Bleeding. Surviving.  
*Real.*

**Mal**  
You’re the meteor this party needed.

**Leo**  
To Sky—the one who made love feel costly.

**Alex**  
Maybe love is a witness. Someone who sees all your edits and stays.

**Sky (toasts again)**  
To destruction. To devotion. To the only thing worth ruining your life for.

**All**  
To love.

*(Lights fade to black.)*

# Act III: The Morning After

**Setting:**  
Dawn. Wine-stained glasses. The loft is quiet. Guests wake slowly.  

**Alex**  
New question. Not *what is love*. But *what do you want it to be*?

**Mal**  
A costume I never want to take off.

**Jules**  
Something quiet. Uncomplicated.

**Dani**  
Something that doesn’t hurt. Or at least makes the hurt worth it.

**Ezra**  
Open source. Self-correcting.

**Leo**  
Forgiving. Especially of age.

**Sky**  
A lover who doesn't want to fix me. Just… loves me broken.

**Alex**  
A witness. Someone who listens.  
Not just to words, but to fears.

**Leo**  
Look at that. We all said something true.

**Sky**  
So what now? Start a commune?

**Mal**  
To *The Love Commune™*.

**Alex (to audience)**  
No gods descended. No truths carved in stone.  
Just people.  
Trying to name the unnamable.  
And love each other despite it.

*(Lights fade. A slow jazz outro. On screen:)*
