# The Edge of Stillness  
### A 90-Minute Stage Play in Three Acts  
*by [Your Name]*  

---

## Characters

- **EMMA (early 30s)** – An insomniac academic on leave. Neurotic, poetic, observant.
- **LIAM (mid 30s)** – Her partner, a public defender. Measured, rational, carrying hidden despair.
- **CLARA (early 30s)** – Emma’s younger sister. Spirited, restless, oscillating between optimism and nihilism.

### Supporting Roles:
- **VOICE** – Heard offstage. A digital assistant, an inner monologue, or death itself.
- **THE STRANGER** – A silent figure appearing only once, representing inevitability.

## Set

A single room.  
It can be a cabin, a bunker, or an Airbnb. It has:  
- A bed or mattress  
- A window (real or imagined)  
- A table with two chairs  
- A door that never opens

Time is fluid. Reality shifts subtly, but the space remains constant.

# Act I: *The Space Between Breaths*

**Lights up. A gray room. Morning. EMMA sits at the table, staring at a coffee cup. LIAM stands by the window.**

---

**EMMA**  
It feels like time has stopped.  
Like the second hand decided this was enough.

**LIAM**  
You’re just tired. You haven’t slept in—

**EMMA**  
—forty-six hours. I’ve counted. Counting is the only thing that doesn’t lie.

**LIAM**  
It’s just a break. You asked for space. From the city. From screens. From noise.

**EMMA**  
What if the quiet’s worse?

---

**CLARA enters, barefoot, wrapped in a hoodie.**

**CLARA**  
I dreamt the house was underwater. Not drowning—just suspended. Like we were waiting for something to move.

**EMMA**  
That’s dread.

**CLARA**  
You always say that like it’s a diagnosis.

**EMMA**  
It is. Anxiety is afraid the moment will never end.  
Dread is afraid it will.

**LIAM (to Clara)**  
She’s been writing again.

**EMMA**  
Not writing. Documenting. There’s a difference.

---

**(They eat in silence. The SOUND OF TICKING begins—growing slowly louder, then stops.)**

---

**VOICE (offstage, distorted)**  
Do you wish to continue?

**CLARA**  
That Alexa?

**LIAM**  
We unplugged her.

**EMMA**  
Then who’s still listening?

---

## Scene 2

**Evening. The same room. The light has shifted blue. CLARA and LIAM play cards. EMMA paces.**

**EMMA**  
Does anyone else feel like we’re not *really* here?

**CLARA**  
I feel like I lost track of which day we arrived. Does that count?

**LIAM**  
Time doesn't matter here. That was the point.

**EMMA**  
No. The point was to rest. To reset. But I feel like I’ve become aware of something I can’t unsee.

---

**(She crosses to the window. There’s only black outside.)**

**EMMA**  
What if this is it?  
This room. This night. Forever.

**CLARA**  
Then we better stock up on wine.

---

# Act II: *The Holding Pattern*

**Days blur. The light never changes anymore. The characters shift seats, exchange roles, become each other’s memory. Dialogue begins to loop, slightly altered.**

---

**LIAM (monologue)**  
At first, I thought silence was a gift.  
Then it started to echo.  
Now I can’t tell if I’m hearing the future or remembering the past.

---

**CLARA**  
Let’s play a game.

**EMMA**  
Everything’s a game now.

**CLARA**  
No, for real. Okay.  
Imagine you only have one minute left. What’s the last thing you’d say?

**LIAM**  
That’s not a game. That’s a trap.

**EMMA**  
No. It’s dread. Wearing a party hat.

---

**VOICE (clearer now)**  
Do you remember how it ends?

---

**(EMMA stands. Lights dim except for one harsh overhead bulb.)**

**EMMA (to the audience)**  
I used to think if I stayed still long enough, I could escape it.  
But dread doesn’t knock.  
It waits inside the silence.  
Anxiety bangs on the door. Dread lives in the walls.

---

## Scene 2: Inversion

**The bed is gone. The window now shows static. The table is upside down. CLARA speaks in a calm, eerie voice.**

**CLARA**  
Do you want to go outside?

**EMMA**  
There is no outside. There’s just... before.

**LIAM**  
And after?

**CLARA**  
There is no “after.” There’s only the waiting and the wondering.

---

**(A faint figure—THE STRANGER—appears at the edge of the stage. No one sees him.)**

---

# Act III: *The Answering Silence*

**Final morning. The room is almost bare. The characters are still, facing different directions.**

---

**EMMA (monologue)**  
This is what’s left:  
Not the fear.  
Not the scream.  
But the hum beneath it.  
The breath you didn’t realize was your last calm one.

---

**CLARA**  
Maybe it’s both.  
Maybe the fear that it’ll never end *is* the same fear that it will.  
Like light and shadow. Same thing. Different angle.

**LIAM**  
So what do we do?

**EMMA**  
Wait.  
Listen.  
Name the silence.

---

**VOICE (final time)**  
Do you wish to exit?

---

**EMMA**  
No.  
I wish to witness.

---

**(THE STRANGER walks slowly across the back of the stage, unnoticed. He exits. The light returns. Normal morning.)**

---

## Final Scene

**The room returns to normal. The table is upright. The window shows a golden dawn. The coffee is hot.**

**EMMA**  
...Did we sleep?

**LIAM**  
Maybe.

**CLARA**  
Does it matter?

**EMMA**  
I think...  
I think the ending wasn’t the point.  
It was the waiting that shaped us.

**(Pause. Then a smile.)**

**EMMA**  
I’m hungry.

**(They laugh. A real laugh. Lights fade.)**
