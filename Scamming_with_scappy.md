# Scammin' with Scappy

- A Modern Farce in Three Acts
- Inspired by Molière's Scapin
- Setting: Miami Beach, present day. Luxury condos, private schools, and trust funds.

## Characters
Scappy Vega - A fast-talking personal assistant with a flair for improvisation and manipulation.

Leo Fortune - Young, idealistic, secretly married, son of a real estate tycoon.

Zane Fortune - Leo's older brother, reckless and charming, in love with a waitress.

Mr. Horace Fortune - Their powerful and controlling father, recently returned from a "digital detox" retreat.

Ms. Gertrude Argento - Zane's mother, ultra-rich, overly dramatic, and highly fashionable.

Isla - A bright, ambitious waitress and Zane's secret love.

Maya - Leo's secret wife, an undocumented performance artist from Colombia.

Silva - Another assistant, constantly overwhelmed, always trailing Scappy.

## ACT I: "Trust Fund, No Trust"

Scene opens on a luxurious Miami Beach penthouse. Zane is pacing in designer sweats. Leo sits on a velvet sofa with his head in his hands.

ZANE
We are so screwed. Dad's back today. That means no more "fun budget," no more "allowance errors," no more pretending this girl I'm in love with is my life coach.

LEO
At least you didn't secretly marry a Colombian sculptor who performs in shipping containers and now needs citizenship and student loans paid off.

ZANE (spinning)
Wait—you married Maya?

LEO
In Key West. It was magical. There were sparklers. But we can't tell Dad. He'd throw me into the Biscayne Bay and bribe the Coast Guard to "lose the report."

ZANE
Alright. We need help. Professional help.

LEO
A lawyer?

ZANE
Worse.
(dramatic pause)
We call… Scappy.

LEO (rising)
No. No. Last time we involved Scappy, he convinced the hotel staff our dad was a reclusive Serbian opera singer and nearly got us extradited from Monaco.

ZANE
Yes, but we made so much money on the TikToks.

(Enter SCAPPY VEGA in a floral button-down, sipping cold brew, phone in hand, earbuds in, dancing to his own beat.)

SCAPPY
Did someone whisper chaos?
Did someone mutter, "God, I wish we had a genius scammer with great hair"?

LEO (sighs)
Why are you always dancing?

SCAPPY
Because I'm paid in anxiety and lies. Dancing is my therapy.
Now. Talk to me, princes of dysfunction. Who'd you marry, impregnate, or bankrupt this time?

ZANE
We're in love.
He married someone.
Dad can't find out.
We need time.
Also, Gertrude's coming too.

SCAPPY
Delightful! I haven't tricked her since the goat yoga scandal.

LEO
Scappy, this is serious. If our dad finds out—

SCAPPY (interrupting)
He'll cut you off, disown you, sell your Tesla for parts, and replace you both with a golden retriever named "Legacy." Yes, yes, stakes are high. So here's what we do:

Phase 1: Diversion. I stage a fake kidnapping and blame it on cryptocurrency pirates.

Phase 2: Emotional Blackmail. Tears. Photoshopped ultrasound. Say no more.

Phase 3: Bribe Silva into hacking the condo's guest list so Maya shows up as a "concierge."

ZANE
You just made all that up on the spot.

SCAPPY (grinning)
Of course I did. Improvisation is the currency of cowards and schemers—and baby, I'm rich.

(Enter SILVA, out of breath, with a tablet and four lattes.)

SILVA
The private chef quit again. Something about "vegan rage." Also, Horace is pulling up now. And Gertrude is FaceTiming from her jet and demanding a fresh orchid for every sentence she speaks.

SCAPPY (to the brothers)
Boys. It's game time.

SCAPPY (monologue aside to audience)
You think love is complicated? Try keeping two entitled trust fund kids out of emotional bankruptcy.
My name is Scappy Vega.
I don't lie—I strategize.
I don't cheat—I pivot.
And by the time this mess is over, they'll be married, rich, and forgiven.
Or I'll be in a shipping container headed for Panama.
Again.

(He winks as music swells and lights dim.)

[End of Act I]


## Scammin' with Scappy ACT II: "Dads, Drones & Deception"

Setting:
Same luxury Miami penthouse. Midday now. Slightly more chaotic. Scappy is in the middle of orchestrating everything—or trying to.

Scene opens with Scappy holding two phones and talking into neither. Silva frantically types on a tablet behind him. Zane is being fitted into an "emotional trauma robe" from Scappy's wardrobe stash. Leo is panicking near the window.

### Scene 1: The Setup

SCAPPY
Okay. Here's the board.

Leo's secret wife? Maya will pose as a visiting immigration officer. Boom—no suspicion.

Zane's forbidden romance? Isla's now your "emotional sobriety coach." Totally legit.

Horace? We distract him with fake news about crypto.

Gertrude? Give her wine, praise her shoes, and keep mirrors around. She'll monologue herself into a coma.

ZANE (buttoning robe)
This feels insane.

SCAPPY
That's because it is. But you're rich, so it's called "eccentric."

SILVA (warning tone)
He's here. Horace just got out of a black SUV with... drones. Three of them. One's scanning for facial recognition.

SCAPPY (composing)
Right. New phase. Codeword: Shakespeare. Silva, initiate drone-looping protocol.

SILVA
That's not a thing!

SCAPPY (smirking)
It is now.

### Scene 2: Horace Enters
(Enter HORACE FORTUNE. Trim, tanned, in all-black athleisure. He's not the tech-ignorant dinosaur everyone expected. A sleek smartwatch flashes data feeds.)

HORACE
I leave for a six-week digital detox and this is what greets me?
Drones trying to scan me like I'm a QR code at brunch?

LEO (nervously)
Hey, Dad. You look... technologically suspicious.

HORACE
What's going on here?

SCAPPY (stepping forward smoothly)
Mr. Fortune. Welcome back. I've arranged everything—scented water, security grid updates, and your mid-afternoon silence bubble.

HORACE
Skip the spa script, Scappy. I can smell lies now. Smelled some on the plane. Pilot was cheating on his boyfriend.
What are you hiding?

ZANE
Nothing! We're just... emotionally growing. You know. Like mushrooms.

### Scene 3: The Slip-Up
(Gertrude FaceTimes in, projected full screen on the smart wall. She's mid-private jet, wearing sunglasses and a silk turban.)

GERTRUDE
Why is my son wearing a robe like he's recovering from a nervous breakdown in Malibu?

ZANE (whispering)
That's the vibe we wanted, Mom.

SCAPPY (rushing in)
Gertrude! Ravishing as always. Your orchid is being ironed as we speak.

GERTRUDE (raising brow)
Where is this "Isla"? I was told she's a trauma consultant. I Googled her. She pours coffee at a Cuban diner and sells astrology candles.

SCAPPY
Healing is nonlinear.

HORACE (crossing arms)
That's enough. I know something's going on. You're all too polite and Scappy hasn't insulted anyone in 30 minutes. What's the real story?

### Scene 4: Scappy's Improvised Masterstroke
(A pause. Everyone panics. Scappy sees Maya walk in—dressed professionally, holding a clipboard. An idea sparks.)

SCAPPY (loudly)
Fine!
You want the truth?

(Everyone freezes.)

SCAPPY (pointing at Maya)
This is Maya Delgado. Homeland Security. She's investigating a suspected crypto-extortion plot involving Cuban bitcoin laundering through... boutique astrology candles.
And Mr. Fortune?
Your sons have bravely volunteered to assist in a sting.

MAYA (playing along immediately)
That's correct. We've been monitoring the situation. And thanks to Leo and Zane, we may finally have a lead.

HORACE (narrowing eyes)
That sounds fake.

MAYA
So does your vitamin IV drip business in Singapore.

(Beat. HORACE nods, impressed.)

HORACE
Touché. Continue.

### Scene 5: The Reversal
GERTRUDE (sighing over FaceTime)
Honestly, this is more exciting than any of my marriages. Let them keep their secrets. It's Miami. We all have bodies buried in our dating apps.

SCAPPY
So... no one's grounded?

HORACE
No one's disowned. Yet.
But I am putting you all on a financial freeze until I know who's lying and who's just dumb.

ZANE
That's not fair!

HORACE
Life isn't fair. Neither are prenups.

(Horace exits dramatically. Maya winks at Leo. Gertrude disconnects.)

SILVA (from the corner)
That. Was. Insane.

SCAPPY (smiling wide)
Just another Tuesday.

SCAPPY (monologue aside)
You can't scheme forever. But you can scheme better than the last guy.
I planted a lie, spun it into art, and sold it as patriotism.
If that isn't America, what is?

(Lights dim.)

[End of Act II]
Would you like Act III next—the finale where Scappy gets caught in his own web, only to spin a final twist and win it all anyway?






You said:
yes


ChatGPT said:
Excellent. Below is Act III of "Scammin' with Scappy", the final act of this modern farce inspired by Scapin, where Scappy's carefully layered web of lies begins to collapse—until, of course, he turns it into yet another scheme.

## Scammin' with Scappy: ACT III: "The Fall and the Flex"
Setting:
Late afternoon in the same Miami penthouse. The sun is low. The aftermath of deception hangs in the air like overpriced incense. Empty cold brew cans and herbal tinctures litter the space. Things are not under control.

### Scene 1: The Unraveling
(Zane is pacing. Leo sits with Maya, who's clearly tired of pretending to be a federal agent. Scappy is nowhere to be seen.)

ZANE
He's gone. Just vanished. Again.

LEO
That's what he does when plans go sideways. He disappears until we fix it ourselves and then takes credit for the emotional growth.

MAYA
You do realize I'm not actually from Homeland Security, right?

LEO
You're not?

MAYA
No, Leo. I'm a sculptor. I build melting busts of politicians out of sugar and shame. Remember?

LEO
God, I love you.

MAYA
I know. That's the terrifying part.

SILVA (bursting in)
Bad news! Horace just posted on LinkedIn about a "radical re-org of his personal dynasty." I think he's disinheriting you via slideshow.

ZANE
We need Scappy. Where is he?

### Scene 2: The Confrontation
(Lights shift. Enter SCAPPY—shirtless, wrapped in a towel, sipping green juice, looking like he just emerged from a spiritual rebirth.)

SCAPPY
Did someone whisper "salvation" and "tax shelter"?

LEO
Where the hell have you been?

SCAPPY
Taking a sound bath with a shaman-slash-divorce-lawyer in the guest sauna. My chakras are open. Also, I had to meditate on betrayal.

ZANE
Wait. You feel betrayed?

SCAPPY (grinning)
Of course not. But I had to say it to make my dramatic re-entry. Now: what's the damage?

MAYA
Horace is on to us. He knows the candle plot was fake. And I'm not even sure he believed the drone thing. Or my clipboard.

SILVA
Also, Gertrude now believes she's dating the CEO of Peloton. That was you, wasn't it?

SCAPPY
She seemed lonely. And I needed her distracted.

### Scene 3: The Great Reveal
(Enter HORACE, silent. Everyone freezes. He crosses the room slowly, like a shark in Gucci loafers.)

HORACE
Enough.
I know everything.

ZANE
Everything?

HORACE
Yes. The fake Homeland agent. The invented candle cult. The emotional sobriety scam. Even the wardrobe budget receipts labeled "strategic textiles."

LEO
...We're really sorry.

HORACE (turning to Scappy)
And you.
The master puppeteer. The manipulator. The schemer.

SCAPPY
Schemer is such a loaded word. I prefer "creative operations consultant."

HORACE (stepping forward)
You could've come clean. You could've told the truth.

SCAPPY (matching his gaze)
And you would've done what? Grounded them? Cut them off? Replaced them with your crypto labradoodle?

(A long beat. Silence. Then—)

HORACE (smiling slowly)
You're good.
Too good.

SCAPPY
Naturally.

HORACE
Which is why I'm offering you a job.

(Everyone gasps. Even Silva drops the tablet.)

HORACE (to the room)
Effective immediately, Scappy Vega is my new chief deception officer.
If you're going to lie, boys—
learn from the best.

### Scene 4: The Wrap-Up
ZANE
Wait, what?

LEO
You're rewarding him?

HORACE
He saved your reputations, preserved your secrets, and managed to increase my social media engagement by 14%. That's more than your mother did in two marriages.

SCAPPY
I accept. But I demand three things:

A black card.

A corner office with ocean view.

A personal masseuse named Leon.

HORACE
Done.

MAYA
Wait, so what happens to us?

HORACE (softly)
You love each other?
Prove it.
Not with lies. Not with schemes. Just… show up. Together. Every day.
If you can do that, I'll even fund your weird sculpture art thing.

MAYA
You're not as evil as you pretend.

HORACE
I'm worse. I'm strategic.

(Music swells. Everyone exhales. Peace—for now.)

### Scene 5: Final Monologue
(Lights narrow to SCAPPY. Alone, center stage. Miami sun behind him.)

SCAPPY (to audience)
And so the chaos ends, not with exile… but a promotion.
I came here with nothing but a suitcase full of wigs, a gift for improvisation, and a caffeine addiction.
Now I run the game.

Because love?
Love is messy.
Family? Even worse.
But if you keep them distracted long enough—
with just enough truth in your lies—
they'll hand you the keys.

(He pulls out a gold card and flips it toward the audience.)

SCAPPY
The trick isn't avoiding the scam.
It's running it better than anyone else.
