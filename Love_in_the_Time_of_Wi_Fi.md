## ACT I: The Toast

**Scene opens in Alex’s loft.** A minimalist, modern interior—polished concrete floors, hanging Edison bulbs, a curated wall of vinyl. A long table set for six with mismatched wine glasses, artisan charcuterie, and hand-rolled sushi.

Soft lo-fi music fades as guests are seated. A half-full bottle of wine passes hands.

**Alex** (raising his glass)
Alright, folks. We’ve debated politics, trash-talked billionaires, and confessed to at least three failed relationships. So let’s do something different. Let’s toast to Love. But—here’s the twist: you’ve gotta give a little speech. Each of you. No rambling. Say what you really think love is. You can be funny, raw, bitter, brilliant—I don’t care. But you gotta be real.

(Laughter and groans all around.)

**Jules**
God, what is this, drunk TED Talk night?

**Alex**
Exactly. Welcome to *Symposium: Brooklyn Edition*. Jules, since you're already complaining, you go first.

**Jules** (smirking, rising)
Fine. Let’s do this. *(She clinks her glass.)*
Love is a biochemical illusion. A cocktail of dopamine, oxytocin, and social conditioning designed to manipulate us into coupling up long enough to replicate our DNA. We call it romance, but it’s basically an evolutionary hack. You’re not falling in love—you’re getting high on a neurochemical scam.
*(beat)*
So cheers to the greatest con nature ever pulled.

*(Polite applause, some chuckles. Dani whistles.)*

**Dani**
Damn, Jules. That made me want to delete Tinder and cry.

**Mal** (leans back, wine glass swirling)
Delicious. Cynicism with a side of science. Now let me offer a counterspell.

*(Stands with theatrical flair.)*

Love is performance. It's theater without script or director. We fall in love when someone reflects a fantasy we already had about ourselves. It’s a mirror, cracked and fogged by desire.
*(He saunters to center stage.)*
I once loved a man so much, I stopped eating solid food for six days. Thought I was transcending. Turned out I was just high and broke.
*(laughs, bows)*
But in those days, my hunger was love. Love is hunger. That ache to be seen, even if you have to bleed for it.

**Ezra** (snorts, shaking his head)
Poetic. But messy. Shall I?

**Alex**
By all means, Captain Algorithm.

**Ezra** (standing like he's giving a pitch to investors)
Love is code. It's pattern recognition. Compatibility isn’t chemistry—it’s compression. The best relationships are data-efficient systems. Two users with compatible operating systems. You share resources. You minimize lag. You optimize outcomes.
*(shrugs)*
And like any program, sometimes love just crashes. Doesn’t mean it wasn’t well-written. It just needed an update you didn’t install.

*(Scattered laughter.)*

**Jules**
Jesus, Ezra. You made love sound like a firmware patch.

**Dani** (softly, rises)
You guys all make love sound so cold.
*(beat)*
Love is…something I can’t prove, or predict. But I feel it. In the way my mom used to pack my lunch with sticky notes. In the way my ex still texts me every year on my birthday, even though he’s married now. Love’s not efficient or rational or performative.
*(He places a hand on his heart.)*
It’s that feeling that someone else’s existence makes the world easier to bear. Even if you don’t end up together.

*(Silence for a moment. Jules wipes at her eye. Mal claps gently.)*

**Alex** (smiling)
Beautiful. And now, the oracle himself.
*(Turns to Leo)*
Professor Valentine, save us from ourselves.

**Leo** (leans forward, gravel voice)
Love is a trick.
*(Everyone turns.)*
A divine bait-and-switch. It promises transcendence, then hands you a leash. And we thank it. We beg it to tighten the knot.
I used to teach about love. Rilke, Sappho, Baldwin, Barthes. But none of them prepared me for the silence after she left.
*(beat)*
So what is love? A haunting. A ghost you let into your bed, hoping it won’t bite.

*(The room falls quiet. A long pause.)*

**Alex** (quietly)
That’s the most honest thing I’ve heard all night.

**Mal** (raising his glass)
To ghosts. To hunger. To data, dopamine, and doomed devotion.

**All**
To love.

*(They clink glasses. Lights fade to black.)*

## ACT II: The Disruption

**Scene opens moments after the toast.** The lights rise to soft amber. Everyone’s settled back into their seats. Some refill glasses. The tone is pensive, the mood fragile.

Suddenly—BANG. A loud knock on the loft door. Everyone startles.

**Alex**
That’s weird. I wasn’t expecting anyone else.

*(He opens the door. A figure leans in the frame, backlit by hallway light. A long coat, tousled hair, smeared lipstick, sunglasses at night. A rolling suitcase behind them.)*

**Enter: Sky Devaux**
Late 30s. Genderfluid actor, scandal-stained socialite, and former lover of Alex. Beautiful in a way that seems accidental. Charisma drips like spilled gin.

**Sky**
Miss me?

*(Alex stiffens.)*

**Alex**
Sky. What the hell are you—

**Sky**
—Doing here? Your little assistant-slash-intern-slash-groupie told me you were hosting another one of your late-night philosophy salons.
*(Peels off sunglasses)*
Figured I’d crash the party. We used to share thoughts. And beds.

*(A pause. The others watch, stunned, fascinated.)*

**Leo** (murmuring to Dani)
Ah. Here comes the storm.

**Alex** (composing himself)
Fine. You want in? Take a chair. But we're in the middle of something.

**Sky**
Perfect.
*(Glides in like they own the place.)*
What’s the theme? Truth? Desire? Who’s sleeping with who?

**Ezra**
Love.

**Sky** (laughs and drops their coat to the floor, revealing a form-hugging outfit underneath)
Of course. You nerds and your endless foreplay with abstraction.
*(Takes a swig from someone’s glass and sits on the edge of the table.)*
Alright then. Here’s my take.

### Sky’s Monologue

Love is violence.
Not the screaming kind. The intimate kind. The quiet invasions. The soft dismantling of who you thought you were.

Love is when someone learns your codes, your weak spots, and says:
“I could ruin you.”
And you say:
“Please.”

You think love is a choice? It’s a fever. A virus. It burns the house down and makes you thank the flames.

I was in love once. With you, Alex.
*(Everyone turns to Alex. He goes rigid.)*
He told me I was “an idea he couldn’t write yet.”
And then he left. For a TEDx talk in fucking Austin.

*(Silence.)*

**Sky** (to the room)
He intellectualized me. Abstracted me. Turned my chaos into content.

Love isn’t theory. Love is mess. It’s screaming in public. It’s ugly crying on someone’s voicemail. It’s bleeding in your UberPool because your ex threw a wine glass.

It’s not noble.
It’s not wise.
It’s real.

**Jules** (quietly)
Jesus.

**Mal** (applauding slowly)
I have goosebumps. You are the meteor this dinner party needed.

**Leo** (raising his glass)
To Sky. The only one tonight who made love feel like it costs something.

**Sky** (bowing)
Cheers, Professor Ghost. You always did get me.

**Alex** (finally speaking)
Sky, you weren’t a theory. You were…
*(He falters.)*
You were too much. I couldn’t hold it. Or maybe I didn’t want to try.

**Sky**
Exactly.
And that, my darling, is love. Knowing someone can’t handle you, and loving them anyway.

*(Lights dim slightly. A silence falls over the room as each character sits with what has just been revealed. The party has changed. The tone is different now: less witty, more haunted.)*

**Dani** (softly)
Maybe none of us actually know what love is.
Maybe it’s just the story we tell to make heartbreak bearable.

**Jules**
Or the lie we keep upgrading to stop ourselves from deleting hope.

**Ezra**
I could build an app for that.

*(Laughter—light, tired. Mal pours more wine.)*

**Alex** (quietly)
Maybe love’s not one thing. Maybe it’s all of this. The algorithm and the ache. The ghost and the performance. The hunger and the burn.

**Leo**
Maybe love is the symposium itself. The ritual. The spilling of wine and guts. The truth only drunken mouths dare speak.

**Sky** (raising a final toast)
Then drink, darlings.
To desire.
To destruction.
To the only thing worth ruining your life over.

**All**
To love.

*(They drink. Lights dim to black. Music fades in: slow jazz or a synth-heavy love ballad.)*

## ACT III: The Morning After

**Setting:**
The same Brooklyn loft.
Dawn leaks through the tall windows—hazy blue and orange. The table is cluttered: half-eaten sushi, crumpled napkins, wine-stained glasses. Some candles still flicker.

Stage is silent. One by one, characters begin to stir. No one is in a rush. There is hangover energy, but also a strange calm.

**Scene opens with Dani and Jules on the couch, sharing coffee in mismatched mugs.** Sky is curled on a lounge chair, still half-asleep. Mal sits on the windowsill, legs dangling. Leo has just lit a cigarette despite everyone’s protests the night before. Alex stands alone at the kitchen island, staring out.

**Dani**
I had a dream I was drowning in a bathtub of DMs.

**Jules**
Probably the most honest metaphor for modern dating I've ever heard.

**Mal**
I dreamed I was being worshipped in a candlelit church that turned out to be a dive bar. Felt right.

**Leo** (exhales smoke)
I didn’t dream. Just remembered.

*(Pause.)*

**Sky** (murmuring, eyes still closed)
You all talk too much in the morning.

**Alex** (turns to face them all)
I’ve been thinking.
Last night was…something. We all dropped pieces of ourselves on that table. Some of it brilliant, some of it bullshit. All of it true.

*(They nod, slowly. No one interrupts.)*

**Alex**
So now I want to ask a different question. Not what is love. But what do you want it to be?

*(Long pause. Mal raises a hand theatrically.)*

**Mal**
I'll go first.
I want love to be a costume I never want to take off. Something that makes me feel more me, not less.

**Jules** (after a beat)
I want love to be...quiet. No fireworks. No acid trips. Just someone who makes the world less exhausting.

**Dani**
I want love to not hurt. Or if it has to, at least make it worth the scars.

**Ezra** (from behind a laptop now open, already halfway back into work mode)
I want love to be a collaboration. Open source. Constantly updated. Bug fixes with every fight.

**Leo**
I want love to forgive me for not being young anymore.

*(Everyone turns to Sky.)*

**Sky** (sits up slowly)
I want love to stop trying to fix me.
Let me be ruinous. Let me be adored for it.

*(Finally, they turn to Alex.)*

**Alex** (softly)
I want love to make me shut up long enough to listen.
Really listen.
Not just to what they say, but to what they fear.
I’ve spent too much of my life trying to define love like it’s a thesis.
But maybe...
Love is a witness. Someone who stays through the contradictions.
Someone who sees the edits and the raw footage—and doesn’t leave during the credits.

*(Silence. Deep. Not heavy—just full.)*

**Leo** (smiling sadly)
Well.
Look at that.
We’ve all said something true.

**Sky** (standing, stretching)
So what now? Do we all make love to each other and start a commune?

**Mal** (raising a toast with a cup of orange juice)
To The Love Commune™. Now taking applications.

*(Laughter—genuine this time. Light. The air feels lighter.)*

### Final Lines

**Alex** (to audience, breaking fourth wall)
We gathered, like they did in Athens. We drank. We argued. We confessed. We ruined and redeemed ourselves, over cheese plates and Pinot Noir.

No gods descended.
No truths carved into stone.

Just people,
Trying to name the unnamable,
And love each other despite it.

*(Lights dim. Lo-fi jazz fades in. A projection on the back wall slowly types out:)*
