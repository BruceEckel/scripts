## ACT I: The Toast

**Scene opens in Alex’s loft.** A minimalist, modern interior—polished concrete floors, hanging Edison bulbs, a curated wall of vinyl. A long table set for six with mismatched wine glasses, artisan charcuterie, and hand-rolled sushi.

Soft lo-fi music fades as guests are seated. A half-full bottle of wine passes hands.

**Alex** (raising his glass)
Alright, folks. We’ve debated politics, trash-talked billionaires, and confessed to at least three failed relationships. So let’s do something different. Let’s toast to Love. But—here’s the twist: you’ve gotta give a little speech. Each of you. No rambling. Say what you really think love is. You can be funny, raw, bitter, brilliant—I don’t care. But you gotta be real.

(Laughter and groans all around.)

**Jules**
God, what is this, drunk TED Talk night?

**Alex**
Exactly. Welcome to *Symposium: Brooklyn Edition*. Jules, since you're already complaining, you go first.

**Jules** (smirking, rising)
Fine. Let’s do this. *(She clinks her glass.)*
Love is a biochemical illusion. A cocktail of dopamine, oxytocin, and social conditioning designed to manipulate us into coupling up long enough to replicate our DNA. We call it romance, but it’s basically an evolutionary hack. You’re not falling in love—you’re getting high on a neurochemical scam.
*(beat)*
So cheers to the greatest con nature ever pulled.

*(Polite applause, some chuckles. Dani whistles.)*

**Dani**
Damn, Jules. That made me want to delete Tinder and cry.

**Mal** (leans back, wine glass swirling)
Delicious. Cynicism with a side of science. Now let me offer a counterspell.

*(Stands with theatrical flair.)*

Love is performance. It's theater without script or director. We fall in love when someone reflects a fantasy we already had about ourselves. It’s a mirror, cracked and fogged by desire.
*(He saunters to center stage.)*
I once loved a man so much, I stopped eating solid food for six days. Thought I was transcending. Turned out I was just high and broke.
*(laughs, bows)*
But in those days, my hunger was love. Love is hunger. That ache to be seen, even if you have to bleed for it.

**Ezra** (snorts, shaking his head)
Poetic. But messy. Shall I?

**Alex**
By all means, Captain Algorithm.

**Ezra** (standing like he's giving a pitch to investors)
Love is code. It's pattern recognition. Compatibility isn’t chemistry—it’s compression. The best relationships are data-efficient systems. Two users with compatible operating systems. You share resources. You minimize lag. You optimize outcomes.
*(shrugs)*
And like any program, sometimes love just crashes. Doesn’t mean it wasn’t well-written. It just needed an update you didn’t install.

*(Scattered laughter.)*

**Jules**
Jesus, Ezra. You made love sound like a firmware patch.

**Dani** (softly, rises)
You guys all make love sound so cold.
*(beat)*
Love is…something I can’t prove, or predict. But I feel it. In the way my mom used to pack my lunch with sticky notes. In the way my ex still texts me every year on my birthday, even though he’s married now. Love’s not efficient or rational or performative.
*(He places a hand on his heart.)*
It’s that feeling that someone else’s existence makes the world easier to bear. Even if you don’t end up together.

*(Silence for a moment. Jules wipes at her eye. Mal claps gently.)*

**Alex** (smiling)
Beautiful. And now, the oracle himself.
*(Turns to Leo)*
Professor Valentine, save us from ourselves.

**Leo** (leans forward, gravel voice)
Love is a trick.
*(Everyone turns.)*
A divine bait-and-switch. It promises transcendence, then hands you a leash. And we thank it. We beg it to tighten the knot.
I used to teach about love. Rilke, Sappho, Baldwin, Barthes. But none of them prepared me for the silence after she left.
*(beat)*
So what is love? A haunting. A ghost you let into your bed, hoping it won’t bite.

*(The room falls quiet. A long pause.)*

**Alex** (quietly)
That’s the most honest thing I’ve heard all night.

**Mal** (raising his glass)
To ghosts. To hunger. To data, dopamine, and doomed devotion.

**All**
To love.

*(They clink glasses. Lights fade to black.)*
